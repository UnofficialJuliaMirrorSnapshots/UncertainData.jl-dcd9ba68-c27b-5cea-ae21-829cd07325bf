# [Statistics on single collections of uncertain data](@id single_dataset_estimate_statistics)

These estimators operate on collections of uncertain values. Each element of such a collection
can be an uncertain value of [any type](@ref uncertain_value_types), such as [populations](@ref uncertain_value_population), 
[theoretical distributions](@ref uncertain_value_theoretical_distribution), 
[KDE distributions](@ref uncertain_value_kde) or 
[fitted distributions](@ref uncertain_value_fitted_theoretical_distribution).

The methods compute the statistic in question by drawing a length-`k` realisation of the `k`-element
collection. Realisations are drawn by sampling each uncertain point in the collection independently. The statistic is then computed on either a single such realisation (yielding a single value for the statistic) or 
over multiple realisations (yielding a distribution of the statistic).

# [Syntax](@id syntax_statistics_collection_single)

The syntax for computing a statistic `f` for single instances of an uncertain value collections is

- `f(x::UVAL_COLLECTION_TYPES)`, which resamples `x` once, assuming no element-wise dependence 
    between the elements of `x`.
- `f(x::UVAL_COLLECTION_TYPES, n::Int, args...; kwargs...)`, which resamples `x` `n` times, 
    assuming no element-wise dependence between the elements of `x`, then computes the statistic 
    on each of those `n` independent draws. Returns a distributions of estimates of the statistic.
